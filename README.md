# SoWhat(Kya Boyein) Mobile Application

## OUR TEAM ACE :
1. Sonali Kumari (BTech ECE-AI, 2nd year, IGDTUW)
2. Debasmita Mondal (BTech MAE, 2nd year, IGDTUW)
3. Shruti Sharma (Btech IT, 2nd year, IGDTUW)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Crop Guidance and Farmers Friend - (BioTech)
The needs of contemporary agriculture, which demands high-yield, high-quality, and efficient production, cannot be met by conventional agricultural practices. Furthermore, farmers face the main challenge of how to adapt to changing customer preferences. It is critical to modernize existing processes and use data acquired over time to determine the best potential farming practices that should be implemented. Develop a solution that uses the potential of AI to address this problem.

## OVERVIEW :  
This is a project made for HackOverflow 2.0 within 48 hours. SoWhat app name indicates a question **"Sow What?"** which is prevalent among farmers regarding what to sow on a particular land. So this app will act as an answer to this long time lingering question as mentioned before. In addtion to prediction this app will suggest some new sustainable agriculture practices to farmers.
Our team had chosen a problem statement related to **Crop Guidance and Farmers Friend - (BioTech)**. We had majorly utilized Machine Learning to make predictions and used Flutter ,Tenseflow and Tenseflow lite to integrate our ML model into a mobile app. This app aims to ease the decision making of farmers.

## INSPIRATION :
Farmers living in different areas have different climates, landscapes, microorganisms, plants and animals so they must adapt their growing practices to local conditions. Managing the decision-making processes of farming has always been complex because there are so many different limiting factors that aren’t within a farmer’s control. So if we can contribute a little to minimize their problem to any extent then also it's overwhelming for our team.

## WHAT OUR TEAM HAD BUILT ?
We had made a mobile app named SoWhat. This app takes input of **Nitrogen** content, **Phosphorous** content, **Potassium** content, **pH value** of soil and **Humidity**, **Rainfall**, and average **Temperature**. Devices (YUVs kit for pH + humidity and npk kit for measuring N, P, K content of soil) are available in the market which are not expensive at all so, it's like a 1 time investment for a farmer.

After getting input of all values from user, it predicts the best crop that can be grown in that particular area with maximum profit. It aware the farmers by providing some additional knowledge regarding some new sustainable methods that they can practise on their land to promote sustainability. 
###### RELEVANCE TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT :
As the problem statement suggests that we have to devise something using AI for farmers that will serve as a solution to one of their problems faced practising conventional  agricultural practises. Our prediction app will help the farmers in selection process of a crop for a particular agricultural land. This will leads to efficient agriculture and maximum utilisation of resources in right direction which in turn is a sustainable practise.
###### BUILT WITH :
* Decision Tree ML model with 99.84% accuracy
* Python, Numpy, Pandas
* Flutter
* Dart
* Tenserflow
* Tenseflow lite

## FEATURES OF SoWhat App
* Decision-making for farmers made easier using AI.
* Available in both hindi and english language.
* Farmers new to an area can be helped for selection of crops.
* Promotes sustainable agriculture.
* Predict suitable crop for an area.
* Minimize inefficient farming.
* Discover easy sustainable agricultural activites within the app.
* Appropriate and right use of resources.
* Saves time of farmers. 

## FUTURE SCOPE :
This app can be enhanced with inclusion of more datasets to inculcate data of more variety of crops. This will result in expansion of prediction area and can be helpful for more and more farmers. Also, we can include video guidance of sustainable practises by experts for better understanding of farmers. 

## INSTRUCTIONS TO USE APP :
1. On homepage of app you'll see 2 options of "Go to crop prediction" and "Sustainable practises".
2. Click on first option if you want to predict.
* Enter all the input values appropriately.
* Click on "Predict" button to get the result.
3. Click on second option if you want to see ways of sustainable practises.
* You'll be directed to a page with list of sustainable agricultural methods.
